A fatal error occurred. The required library hostfxr.dll could not be found.    
If this is a self-contained application, that library should exist in [C:\..\
\..\..\ExtremeCodeOS\Compiler\build\].                             
If this is a framework-dependent application, install the runtime in the global 
location [C:\Program Files\dotnet] or use the DOTNET_ROOT environment variable t
o specify the runtime location or register the runtime location in [HKLM\SOFTWAR
E\dotnet\Setup\InstalledVersions\x64\InstallLocation].                          
                                                                                
The .NET Core runtime can be found at:
